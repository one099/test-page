# Page for Testing

This is a repo I created just to test deployment of my pages or elements/components I would be using in them.

I might also use this to archive some of those components as well.

These components would most probably be the ones I will be using in some of my future projects, which would also include my porfolio/personal website.

## Deployment

This is deployed using github pages: [Check It Out!](http:two048.github.io/test-page)

## Note

I will be making a list page for this repo soon - to help with the process of archiving and documentation.
